CharPad - Import file formats 
------------------------------
          
    
Character Sets...

CharPad's data importer expects character sets to be in raw data format, that is, the file 
size should be exactly NUM_CHARS * 8 bytes in length.
                


Tile Sets...

CharPad's data importer expects a tile set file to begin with a 2 byte header...

[0] Tile Width
[1] Tile Height

The quantity of tiles contained in the file (and verification of file size) can then
be calculated based on the file size.

The tile data itself should be in the usual left-to-right, top-to-bottom format with 
each tile immediately following the previous.
                


Maps...

CharPad's data importer expects a map file to begin with a 4 byte header...

[0] Map Width (Low Byte)
[1] Map Width (High Byte)
[2] Map Height (Low Byte)
[3] Map Height (High Byte)

The map data should then follow in the usual left-to-right, top-to-bottom format.
