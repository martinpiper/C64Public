    <b>Does Anyone Still Use a Commodore 64?</b>
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>For anything serious?... unlikely.</p>
  <p>The Commodore 64 was a very popular computer in the 1980's and despite attempts by Commodore
    to market it as a business machine, thanks to it's (then) advanced audio/visual hardware, it
    quickly gained great popularity as a games machine.</p>
  <p>In recent years, interest in the Commodore 64 has seen a resurgence, why?, perhaps some
    combination of these things...</p>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b>Hardware Nostalgia.</b>
  </p>
  <p>As our computer technology has advanced, our ability as users, to fully comprehend and
    control it has massively declined, the home computers of the 1980's may represent the very last
    generation of machines that actually came with a programming manual and a thrilling sense of some
    enormous potential that, with learning and effort, might be unlocked.</p>
  <p>Technical limitations can act as a highly motivating force for the creative mind and the
    home computers of the 1980's provided exactly that.</p>
  <p>
    <b>Emulators.</b>
  </p>
  <p>Commodore 64 emulators are software packages that run on modern computers and can accurately
    reproduce (in software) the inner workings and experience of using the real machine.</p>
  <p>The most popular ones (at the time of writing) are probably VICE (x64) and CCS64.</p>
  <p>
    <b>Software Nostalgia.</b>
  </p>
  <p>Literally thousands of the old classic games and demos can now be found quite easily on the
    internet as free digital downloads.</p>
  <p>These can be run inside emulators or transferred to physical media and played on the real
    thing.</p>
  <p>Over the last twenty years, a great many people have devoted their time to create high
    quality digital reproductions of most of the old disks, tapes, and cartridges and even a large
    volume of high-resolution colour scans of the original packaging, artwork and manuals can now
    be found with minimal effort.</p>
  <p>
    <b>New software.</b>
  </p>
  <p>The Commodore 64 has a devoted community of fans, developers and artists who enjoy making
    new games and demos for the old hardware, they often come equipped with modern tools and fresh
    new ideas.</p>
  <p>CharPad is for them.</p>
