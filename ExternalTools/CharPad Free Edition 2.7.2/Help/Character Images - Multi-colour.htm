    <b>Multi-colour character images.</b>
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>Multi-colour character images are 4x8 pixels in size and use a bit-depth of 2 bits-per-pixel.</p>
  <p>They can therefore use four colours...</p>
  <p>&#x2022; Background colour (0-15), defined in the VIC colour register at memory address $d021 (53281). Pixel = "00".</p>
  <p>&#x2022; Multi-colour 1 (0-15), defined in the VIC colour register at memory address $d022 (53282). Pixel = "01".</p>
  <p>&#x2022; Multi-colour 2 (0-15), defined in the VIC colour register at memory address $d023 (53283). Pixel ="10".</p>
  <p>&#x2022; Foreground colour (0-7), screen-position dependent, defined in the colour-RAM matrix from
    $d800 (55296). Pixel = "11".</p>
  <br />
  <p>When the VIC chip is operating in multi-colour character mode, it uses a mechanism that allows high-resolution character
     images to be displayed as well.</p>
  <p>The foreground colour value (in the colour-RAM matrix) is reduced to just 3 bits to specify
     a colour (0-7) and the highest bit (of the nybble) is used to select multi-colour mode for any
    particular screen cell.</p>
  <p>ie. any character image displayed in a screen cell using a colour value between 0-7 will
     appear in high-resolution mode.</p>
  <p>Any character image displayed in a screen cell using a colour value between 8-15 will appear
     in multi-colour mode.</p>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b>Notes...</b>
  </p>
  <p>Multi-colour character images are displayed using double-width pixels so their visible size
    is actually the same as that of high-resolution character images.</p>
  <p>In standard character-mode (without using raster tricks), the Commodore 64 can display up to
     256 different character images on-screen.</p>
  <p>The following formula can be used to determine the memory address for a particular colour-RAM cell...</p> 
  <p>55296 + (y * 40) + x</p>
