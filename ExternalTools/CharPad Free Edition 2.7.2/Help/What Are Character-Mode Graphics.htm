        <b>What Are Character-Mode Graphics?</b>
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
        Character-mode graphics provide a faster alternative to bitmap-mode graphics by
        filling the screen space using a library of small (same-sized) images.
    </p>
    <p>
        This hardware-supported display technique bypasses the need to process individual
        pixels (in software) when writing new data to the screen and results in a considerably
        smaller video matrix, this greatly reduces the amount of processing required to
        apply full-screen visual changes.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Commodore 64 comes equipped with two sets of 256 (8x8 pixel) images in it's
        Read-Only-Memory (ROM), these include all of the standard alpha-numeric characters
        and punctuation symbols needed to represent on-screen text, hence the name 'character-mode',
        but with a small amount of programming it is possible to use any set of images you
        like.
    </p>

        <b>Notes...</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        The Commodore 64 has an addressable screen space of 320x200 (64,000) pixels.
    </p>
    <p>
        In bitmap-mode, each group of 8 horizontally consecutive pixels is encoded into
        a single byte (8 bits) so the video matrix requires 8000 bytes.
    </p>
    <p>
        Character-mode uses a video matrix of 40x25 (8x8 pixel) cells which equates
        to just 1000 bytes.
    </p>
    <p>
        A single character set of 256 (8x8 pixel) images requires 2048 bytes (2KB), each
        character image requires 8 bytes.
    </p>
