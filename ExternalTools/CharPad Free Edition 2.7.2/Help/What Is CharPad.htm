        <b>What is CharPad?</b>
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
        CharPad is a graphics data editing tool that can be used to create and edit graphics
        data in a format that is compatible with the 'character mode' of the classic (1982)
        Commodore 64 home computer.
    </p>
    <p>
        It can be used to create and edit a set of character images and the associated data
        structures (tile sets and maps) that are commonly used to define rectangular arrangements
        of character images and tiles in 2D video games.
