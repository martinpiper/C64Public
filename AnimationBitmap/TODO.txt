* Animation1 - Large spinning Hunrter's Moon spaceship
	cls && Conv2_1.bat && ConvDelta2_1.bat && BuildIt2.bat
	The raw frames were from a gif, and were converted by Animation\conv.bat into the Animation1 directory.
	The converted image frames are converted to C64 format frame data by: Conv2_1.bat
		Note the frame range in the bat file.
	The delta compression then converts the C64 format frame data with: ConvDelta2_1.bat
		Again note the frame range in the bat file.
		This compression options assume the animation will loop and also that the last two frames are already in memory.
		This means the last delta frame will compress the back to the first frame.
		The first displayed frame will use the delta to reconctruct the first frame from the last two frames in memory.
		These are two bitmap buffers in memory, the displayed framed and a working off-screen frame.
		These two buffers are in two adjacent VIC banks, this means two frames worth of data can be used for delta compression pattern matching.
		The delta compression also uses a dictioary, which is a block of memory that contains very highly used sequences of data.
		This dictionary is cheaper, in terms of compression size, to access. Think of it like a cache of frequently used data.
	Build the example code with BuildIt2.bat which assembles AnimationBitmap2.a
		This writes the code and delta data to a new cartridge.
			AnimationBitmap.crt
		It also writes tries to save extra data by applying a compression post process to the delta files using the lzmpi tool.
			AnimationBitmapCompressed.crt
			This is slower, note TestingExtraCompression extra decompression check, but can save some bytes...
			Note the option "-l 32 $800" which specifies the lower and upper range for the source data size limits (for the delta frames).
			Anything outside this range wil not be compressed.
			Also note that this uses "CompressedDataTemp = $7800" for decompressed output space, which only makes sense if $7800 is excluded during the delta compression.
				This is because that data *must not be considered* during delta compression as it's not valid image data.
			For Animation1, which is a full screen bitmap, this $7800 memory range is used by the bitmap, so the compression doesn't work properly. This is expected and normal.


* Animation8 - For the Hunter's Moon intro and outro animations, no music or text just the video
	cls && Conv.bat && ConvDeltaHMSequence.bat && BuildIt2.bat
	>> This can use compression TestingExtraCompression, note the "The temporary decompression space" in ConvDeltaHMSequence.bat
		>>> set EXCLUDEPANEL=-excludeposend $7400 $7c00
		>>> CompressedDataTemp now = $c000 and compressed data size updated to $1000 from $800



* Animation8 - For the Hunter's Moon intro and outro sequences with music, text, etc
	cls && Conv.bat && ConvDelta.bat && BuildIt.bat && cls && ConvPrint.bat
	This generates AnimationBitmapPreview.crt which uses AnimationBitmapPre.a to remove fade delays
	And AnimationBitmap.crt which includes the full code as in the game
	Note:
		PreBoot_AnimationSelect			= $3fe
			kPreBoot_AnimationSelect_Intro	= 0
			kPreBoot_AnimationSelect_Outro	= 1
	$3fe can be set to 1 by setting a breakpoint at $c000 in the monitor (bk c000) and then using: > 3fe 1




// NOTE: ConvDelta2.bat needs these values set correctly for the number of frames used:
	set START=0
	set STEP=1
	set END=99

* Using REU http://www.zimmers.net/anonftp/pub/cbm/documents/chipdata/programming.reu
	Try to use the REU to accelerate the copying
	But EasyFlash cannot be used due to its registers at $df00 conflicting with the REU registers, will need to use gmod2
	Alternatively, just write out the REU RAM file directly so it contains all the needed frame data
	To get the best benefit of compression DeltaCompression.exe should be altered to:
		Store most of the new data in REU memory, the whole file effectively becomes the dictionary, where it can be copied into the C64 memory quickly later on
		Separate frame data for:
			Skip code
			Block copy from C64 to REU temporary and back to another C64 area (this is if the frame data is not present in REU frame data)
			Block copy from REU to C64
	REU for MDeltaDecompression_CopyColours



* MashSamples
	Could it use u-law instead for better quality?
		import librosa
		import numpy
		y, sr = librosa.load(filename, samplerate, True) #load file
		numpy.clip(y, -1, 1, y) #Clip samples
		norm = librosa.mu_compress(y, mu=15, quantize=True) #mu-compress and quantize to 16 different values
		norm = norm + 8 #offset the samples values
		bin8 = numpy.uint8(norm) #convert to 8-bit unsigned



* Dragon's Lair - Needs a better way to read the video and audio start lo/hi/bank information
	An indexed table of animation chunks would do
	This would replace all the references to address/bank in GameState_null and all GameState_* sections


* Video could be made smaller, leaving more time for samples and the colour RAM update
	Done



* Dragon's Lair colour update could do with only copying the smaller section of screen updated, not the whole screen



* Perhaps the image quality for Dragon's Lair can be improved by telling ffmpeg/mogrify to use the target C64 palette first?
	https://imagemagick.org/script/mogrify.php



* Document DeltaCompression.exe options. Especially those like "-fragment $c00 Data\frm*05d.sno" and how it iteracts with "-fragment f$d00 Data\Dictionary1.bin"



* Note TestingExtraCompression from the extra compression pass in MakeCart
	* It works, but it is slower and doesn't maintain 15 fps
	* For now it's disabled
		BuildIt2.bat outputs...
		AnimationBitmap.crt
		AnimationBitmapCompressed.crt
		totalbyteSize=317780
		totalbyteSize=200712
		for the compressed data size (edited) 
		so it's about 30% smaller extra compressed
		but notice how the extra compression is slower
		Still just about usable though
	* Done - !source "../Decompression/DecompressionVars.a" could be moved into ZP?
	* Done - Trim the 2 bytes of the LZMPi output file in MakeCart
		totalbyteSize=196555



* .notSpecialEscape could actually be one 0, not two 0 since the first 0 is impossible as an escape due to the bmi/bpl being used



* Try to vertically center the outro video without killing memory



* Try various compression options for CharPack on a per frame basis
	This means the DeltaCompression tool will drive conversion of input BMPs via CharPack and cycle through the various options.
	For example try combinations of:
		* -forceordering -reducebitmapchange t.scr t.col




* Or create a decision point list, and iterate over the decision points until the more optimal dictionary choice is used?




* I really need to put a frame counter display in there that shows the time and number of frames displayed when it loops at the end :smile:
	and then calculate the average FPS



* Add an option to become increasingly lossy for compression...
