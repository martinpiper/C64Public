-- TODO

** TODO: Compare with the option of not using the dictionary at all, disabling the extra bit output etc


* After more files get added and the dictionary is full, scan for and prune dictionary data that isn't well used. To free up entries for more file later on.
	Can do this for all but the last file.
	Then re-run the compression again to try to fill the dictionary?
		Is a full dictionary after a prune pass the most efficient option?



* Include automatic aggressive compression searching.
	For a list of files and dictionary size
		Shuffle the files
		Try different dictionary optimisation
		Try dictionary pruning with various lower thresholds and before which files
		Try adding small tweak value to the length calculation
