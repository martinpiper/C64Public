* Option of playing soundFX/music from interrupt instead of mainline. This will mean that any SFX play request will need to be queued and executed inside the interrupt.
	* Added Scroller_DoMusicUpdateInIRQ - The test works well, no music slowdown as expected
	Still need a way to queue sound effect play requests into the IRQ. Basically when Scroller_DoMusicUpdateInIRQ is defined then MusicPlayerPlaySFX and MusicPlayerPlay can be redirected.
	Perhaps MusicPlayerPlaySFX can be a small routine that takes the sound effect number, increments it by 1, then stores it in a suitable small 3 entry buffer.
	Then MusicPlayerPlay takes the small 3 entry buffer, any non-zero value is then decremented and used.
	* Observation: Due to the timing of MusicPlayerPlay in the IRQ, after the panelIRQDone is flagged, then it should be rare that MusicPlayerPlaySFX is called inside the MusicPlayerPlay IRQ anyway. So is it needed?
		Instead perhaps make MusicPlayerPlaySFX a little bit more IRQ aware and robust?




* With Scroller_RunJumpDemo_RunJumpTest
	Override the player jumps, and instead directly input long scroll requests in a "hexagon" shape (r,dr,d,dl,l,ul,u,ur...), to make it easier to trigger the scroll mitigation code



* Consider having an option to unroll ScrollerAnimation.a:AnimationUpdateMultiplexor, create Scroller_EnableUpdateMultiplexorSpeedCode, to remove all indexing
	Also ScrollerAnimation.a:AnimationUpdateMultiplexorPre
	Also Scroller.a:UpdateSprites
	It would even be possible to have dedicated speed code for each variation of scrollerRealMovementXPixels and scrollerRealMovementYPixels
	* Adding a AnimationSpriteType would mean unallocated sprites can be skipped instead of testing AnimationYPos with $ff





* For Screen splits, especially the score panel split:
	Calculate what sprites will be active on the target line and the expected y scroll and produce optimised routines for each combination
	* Lees important now since the split now forces all sprites to be enabled on the scan line giving a stable split.
		Due to sprite DMA triggering delaying the CPU until the correct point.




; MPi: TODO: If not IRQOpenBorders then IrqTopOfScreen does not need to be at raster pos 0, it can be moved downwards to just before the first sprites are needed
; MPi: TODO: Perhaps not the best idea since any games that wait for BeforeScrollers/AfterScrollers for their work will want to have as much time above for animation and sprite updates




* Tidy use of !for with (.x-1) etc inside Scroll_*.a with !set/!do



* Make the bat files generic so they can be used by other projects using this framework



* Think about block data swizzling. Perhaps it's more optimal to have block data stored in different patterns?
	Especially for the different register requirements during the horizontal/vertical strip screen plots
	; Optimise the block plot and screen scroll loops. Unroll more.



; MPi: TODO: If the sort is already after the multiplexor end (and the sprite collisioon is off) then just do the full copy and sort without buffering.



* The screen scroll and especially colour scroll should be split into two sections, the top half is before the multiplexor sort after the screen split, the second half is after the multiplexor sort.




; Aimed fire improvement by taking into account any scroll speed, player movement and distance, then aim for that spot.



; MPi: TODO: Add horizontally/vertically scrolling demo for platform game controller with standard gravity and velocity.


; MPi: TODO: For smoothed enemy movement. When an enemy is spawned calculate its entire delta movement every frame with a smoothing target based algorithm. Like the old style camera movement algorithms from long time ago.
;	It needs to be delta movement per frame so it can take into account any scrolling movement of course.
;	delta = (targetPos - currentPos) * 0.9 (or some suitable close fraction that is easily calculated in binary using div/mul 2)


; MPi: TODO: Double check directional and directional hold fire bullet animations from moving and stationary enemies that are either directional, directional hold or sequenced animations.
; Check moving and bullet speed 0 stationary bullets.
; Write tests. Satisfy the tests.
; It seems as though a bullet speed of zero results in incorrect animation direction calculation due to:
;	jsr AnimationConvertXYToDirection
;	ldx tempWork7
;	sta AnimationDirectionIn,x
; Solution: If the input direction is set by the player, i.e. it isn't random, then use the direction instead of calculating it.



; MPi: TODO: Push scroller, when the player death animation is playing it's possible to push scroll the screen with the joystick.
; Maybe only when the players are linked?



; MPi: TODO: Double check the sprite X and Y placement in normal SEUCK and horizontal SEUCK.
; See Scroller_SpriteXAdjust and Scroller_NoSpriteYAdjust
; Check final placement of enemies with scrolling levels that scroll to static screens and also
; just the static screens. Check push scroll as well.
; In the horizontal SEUCK games there is a chance the sprites are appearing one pixel offset from
; where they should be.
; I have a theory the problem is with the original SEUCK code where the sprites can lag one frame
; position behind a scroll. This does mean that there is no easy fix since while scrolling people
; might have placed their sprites to compensate for this one frame lag. In this case just make
; sure the sprite position is correct when the screen is static or stops scrolling (like that 
; scroll after a push scroll).



; MPi: TODO: Add configuration to shift the screen split down one or two characters giving different size bottom areas.
; Things to tweak: scorePanelPos1 , (19*40) and (20*40) will need to be optionally enabled, MACROScrollerBottomAdjust , MACROScrollerDrawVStrip, MACROScrollerDrawVStripColour, ScrollerDrawStripBottomBank,
; ScrollerDrawStripBottomColour, DrawMap
; InitBank0Data and ClearGameScreens where it copies the screen lines at 20*40
