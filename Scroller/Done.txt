; MPi: TODO: The main displayed area needs to mirror the first line of the score panel to improve the split.
;		Can then move the multi-colour panel split change to inside the bitmap+ECM area and not have the FLD flickering bug


; Stablised the score panel split for most cases. Sprites still cause some timing problems sometimes.


.hitSomethingTyped was sometimes getting a recently, within the same frame, removed AnimationType of $ff from an enemy bullet that hit the player with a player bullet nearby.
	This caused the recently removed enemy bullet to transform into a player dying animation.
	Now animation type is checked in the collision routine.



* Directional and directional hold animations are a lot better now.



; When Scroller_NeedFullColourScroll is not defined then look at splitting the char scroll onto two frames, use the now vacant colour scroll time.
; Can be done quite easily since they're split anyway.




* Add code to handle the slightly less memory hungry full colour per char mode in "ExternalTools\CharPad 2.0 310715\Examples (CTM5)\Examples - Rips\Turrican 2 - 4x4\Turrican 2 L2-2.ctm"
	Instead of a duplicate set of block data that contains colorus per block char cell, the colour mapping is on a per character basis, so constant for each character, not inside each block.
	194 char's data at $14
	colour mapping is at $624 at $14 + (numMapUsedChars * 8)
	172 blocks at $14 + (numMapUsedChars * 8) + numMapUsedChars stride 2
	170x48 map at $14 + (numMapUsedChars * 8) + numMapUsedChars + (numMapUsedTiles*4*4*2) stride 2
	* Added CharColoursForEveryCharacter = 1




* Avoid calling these functions during the title screen state
	ScrollerDemoWaitMultiplexHook
	ScrollerDemoWaitScorePanelHook
	ScrollerDemoWaitTopIRQHook
	* Added TitleScreen_Enable_ScrollerDemoWait_Hooks flag

	
	
	
* Consider using cartridge based speed code for unrolled screen scrolling code.

	Code and data would need to be re-arranged to account for $8000-$9fff being mapped at ROM sometimes
		Cycles per char
			Looping	4 + 4 + 2 + 3	= 13
			Speed	4 + 4			= 8
		Code size:
			Looping:	ScreenScrollerCodeEnd - ScreenScrollerCodeStart = 2484 - 1c04 = 880
			Speed:		40 * 20 * 8 * 2 * 6 = 12C00 (12C0 per bank per direction, so need 16 ROM banks for 8 way 2 banks)
	ScrollerStrips has self modifying code so it's not a candidate
	* Will need a common batch file for creating the relevant scroller binaries
		* Can import values from the map
	* and creating a crt image
	http://codebase64.org/doku.php?id=base:crt_file_format#ocean_type_1
	* bin\MakeCart.exe already supports larger carts with higher bank numbers
	Added code to ScrollersNoColour.a to use +Scroller_ScrollExecCartBank
	Adding scroller code into CartCode, this will then get added to a cart image
		cd /d c:\Work\C64\Scroller\CartCode
		..\..\acme.exe -o c:\temp\t0.bin ScrollerNoColour0To1_1.a
		..\..\acme.exe -o c:\temp\t1.bin ScrollerNoColour1To0_1.a
		..\..\bin\MakeCart.exe -n -b 9 -r c:\temp\t0.bin -c 0 0 $2000 -w -r -b 10 -r c:\temp\t1.bin -c 0 0 $2000 -w -b 11 -r c:\temp\t0.bin -c 0 0 $2000 -w -b 12 -r c:\temp\t0.bin -c 0 0 $2000 -w -o c:\temp\t.crt
	** This will need changes to the IRQ hanlders, including the multiplexor, to allow their "rti" use to be changed to a "jmp MinimalIRQServiceRoutine" or similar IRQ exit routine.
	* In Scroller\Scrollers.a ScrollBank*To*_* and ScrollColour_* routines also need +Scroller_ScrollExecCartBank additions
	* First add code to make ProcessorPortDefault or ProcessorPortKERNALWithIO selectable in addition to ProcessorPortAllRAMWithIO for Scroller\ScrollEntryCommon.a.
	* Then add code to handle the cart banking scrollers
	* Added Scroller_UseKernal
	** Screen score panel split IRQ entry timing needs adjusting by the cycles for the kernal routine at FF48
		= cycles 3 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 3 + 5
		== 29 cycles
		ScorePanel1Quick
		ScorePanel1
	* Added automatic build for left/right directions using the CartCode source files
	* Done - When Scroller_FullScreen is used with IRQOpenBorders the kernal NMI code needs to be added. Similar to Multiplex_IRQExit but use Multiplex_NMIExit
	* Don't forget to seyup ScreenBTemp in BuildIt.bat for the colour scrollers
	* Added automatic build for up/down directions using the CartCode source files
	* Need diagonals... *sigh*
	** Done 39
	** Done -39
	** Done 41
	** Done -41




* SEUCK Redux code enabled, with Scroller_UseKernal and when loading it from a cart doesn't work.
	But the multi-directional scroll build with speed code does work with cart.
	It looks like BASIC is being switched on when the title screen is displayed?
		lda #Scroller_KillCartridgeBank
		sta EASYFLASH_BANK
		lda #EASYFLASH_CONTROL_KILL
		sta EASYFLASH_CONTROL




* Use the MakeCart -f option to more efficiently pack the speed code, since it is position independant code it can execute from anywhere in the cart's bank
	Can also take into account the Scroller_MultiDirectionNoDiagonals flag to reduce the size of the data needed even further
	Scroller_ScrollExecCartBank can also use cart access macros or common code from EasyFlash_Code.a

	
	
* Narrow the split, to increase score panel space or increase screen draw space.
	* Debug by adding the ability to force Y position offsets and frameScrollY updates for range testing
	Added Multiplex_DefaultPatternYPosTweak and Scroller_DebugSplit




* Added Scroller_DiscardMinSpriteYPos : Set this to allow the AnimationUpdateMultiplexor to skip sprites above this limit




*	@47/205
	> d011 17
	@ 34/256
	> d011 13
	Screen height is not changed, causing the score panel to be displayed one char line earlier



; For map types where each character is mapped to a specific colour (block colour data is *not* duplicated in the block data)
; then the side colour update can be a fast unrolled section of code that does a lookup based on the screen data that will be switched to.
; This means the colour block plot doesn't need to do so much work.
	* Added Scroller_EnableBlockColourSpeedCode




* If Scroller_EnableSpeedCode and Scroller_EnableBlockColourSpeedCode is enabled then make sure the Scroller_EnableBlockColourSpeedCode enabled strips code is removed from RAM into ROM only
	Added calculated Scroller_EnableBlockColourSpeedCodeInCart



* Using the MakeCart +! option to force memory location $8000



* Update to use GMod2, 8KB banks
	* Different cart boot code, use runstop to cause it to do a normal boot
	* The speed code scrollers might need splitting, into their separate top/bottom half routines, to squeeze them into 8KB banks instead of 16KB banks



* Added ScrollerStripsCodeSize/Start/End to aid debugging




* Unroll the block plotting code for characters
	* A bit like the code for Scroller_EnableBlockColourSpeedCode
	* Also put this code in the cart banks if Scroller_EnableSpeedCode is enabled and remove from RAM
	* Tricky because the block data can be under the cart ROM that is banked in...
	Before with no debug colours: ScrollerStripsCodeSize  =$5cf
	* Done - DataCheck.a - Use this to check for all the externally referenced data
	* Done - Split into ScrollerStripsTop/Bottom/Left/Right.a to prepare for Scroller_EnableBlockStripsSpeedCodeInCart versions later
	* When Scroller_EnableBlockStripsSpeedCode then unroll bottom/top/right/left versions
		Done - MACROScrollerDrawHStripUnrolled + top + bottom
		Done - MACROScrollerDrawVStripUnrolled + left + right
	* Create Scroller_EnableBlockStripsSpeedCodeInCart like Scroller_EnableBlockColourSpeedCodeInCart
		Add extra Scroller_EnableBlockStripsSpeedCodeInCart option that is activated with Scroller_EnableSpeedCode like that used for Scroller_EnableBlockColourSpeedCodeInCart
	* When Scroller_EnableBlockStripsSpeedCodeInCart assemble the unrolled code separately
		Make sure used variables/defines are extracted by sed in BuildIt.bat
