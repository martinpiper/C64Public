* Game design, like Smash TV: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIPn7RZJ4vg
	Probably char based bullets.
	Probably use the SFX player, not the music player this time.




* Very quick charset for a level? Simple geometry with simple lighting?
	Blocks that can be used to generate a "room"
	Bullets...



* Remove table based random number generator and just use RandLEToA



* Use kernal rand instead?



* EntityUpdate_Monster needs a way for monsters to avoid other monster positions for movement
	Probably a hidden character screen, also can be used for collision detection with bullets




* Monster energy, based on body...



* Move certain entity tables into zeropage



* Remove finger print if memory is tight?
