	; Even with SEI by changing to ProcessorPortAllRAM and moving data right to the end of memory it does mean pressing restore will cause a crash
	; because the end of RAM contains the NMI vector. After checking a few other decrunchers which move to the end of memory they also suffer the same problem.

	; Now copy the compressed data to the top of memory, backwards of course.
