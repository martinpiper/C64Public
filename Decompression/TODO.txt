-- TODO

* In the -c64mr and -c64 code there seems to be a problem if the end of memory to decompress to is right at the end of RAM, the $ffff check is failing to detect the loop around to $0000
	* Done - Use BDD6502 to load and run the output compressed file and check the resultant data with the input data is correct
		* Note test would have to account for this by setting the stack pointer to what the C64 has during a SYS statement: ; Assume the SP is at (or very near) $f6
	* Perhaps add a last resort check in RNXPCompressionDecompress_WriteByte, after inc RNXPCompressionDecompress_WriteByte+2 then beq to .gotVeryLongLength or where RNXPCompressionDecompress_ExitCodeDefined is used
		This will at least stop the written byte cycling round back to 0
	* What would be good is to spot the case where with -c64* when the endAddress >= $fff8 or when using -c64mr* and the endAddress >= $fffe then switch to using the decompression code with
		an extra lda #<fixup byte XX> sta $fff8 etc before the jmp. The endAddress for the compressed data would need to be tweaked to be less than the hard end.
		This will then properly handle the extra end compressed stream bytes without needing extra (and slower) RNXPCompressionDecompress_WriteByte hi address overflow detection
		Worst case is that -c64* needs 8 bytes and -c64mr* needs 2 bytes for the end data marker




* Note: // Check for a compressed file with a known self decompressing header
	And: 0x8f0 - sStartOfBASIC
	The 0x8f0 appears to be based on just the LZMPi method, not RLE which is using much shorter code
	Would need to be expanded to support the max RLE modes
	Consider dropping support for decompression of self extracting files




* in this code:
	.workLen = $fd
	.tempLoopVal = $ff
	.workLen should be 16 bits, and .tempLoopVal is not referenced by label, but its memory is used as part of .workLen+1
	So tidy up the code and make sure the ambiguity is resolved and the correct 16 bit size is reserved for workLen




* Strange case where with -c64mr when the ending address is not aligned to a page the decompression end check is not triggering correctly.
	* .smRLEByte is correctly encountered, however it looks like the last RLE for the last byte if it's not page aligned is one too many?
	* Maybe a problem in the output data?



* No need for this code in C64\Decompression\DecompressRLE.a
		jsr RNXPCompressionDecompress_GetByte
		clc
		adc RNXPCompressionDecompress_WriteByte+1
		sta .smEndTestL+1
		jsr RNXPCompressionDecompress_GetByte
		adc RNXPCompressionDecompress_WriteByte+2
		sta .smEndTestH+1
	The values can be pre-calculated and just stored by the self extracting code
