* Add another option for the decompressor that uses all low code $2-$1ff instead of $334 to $3ff
	-c64m or -c64mb to enable "max" mode.
	Now $200-$ffff can be used for decompression, but it kills the vectors and the rest of zeropage.
	


* Add an option to use the DecompressRLE.a code for -c64 and -c64m options in LZMPi.exe
	* Will need to create to create versions of TestDecompression2.a (non-max) and TestDecompression3.a (max ode) that use the RLE code
	* Done - Created TestDecompression3RLE.a without border effect
		It can be used for non-max and max mode since the code is tiny and sits just before the stack and partially into the stack
	* Not done - Add border effect, use of RNXPCompressionIncBorder_A, to DecompressRLE.a
	* Done for -c64mr, nor -c64mrb - Then import those binary blobs into the LZMPi (Compression) project




* Automate the creation of the sC64Decomp* data blocks from the C64\Decompression code
	* Include automatic detection of the theC64Code[0x offsets by reading the labels from the automated assembly output
	* This assembles and outputs the prefix TestDecompression2 for all LauncherAddress labels:
		..\acme.exe -v4 --msvc TestDecompression2.a && ..\ExternalTools\Gnu\bin\sed.exe -n "/LauncherAddress/s/^/TestDecompression2/p" TestDecompression.map
		..\acme.exe -v4 --msvc TestDecompression3.a && ..\ExternalTools\Gnu\bin\sed.exe -n "/LauncherAddress/s/^/TestDecompression3/p" TestDecompression.map
		..\acme.exe -v4 --msvc TestDecompression3RLE.a && ..\ExternalTools\Gnu\bin\sed.exe -n "/LauncherAddress/s/^/TestDecompression3RLE/p" TestDecompression.map
		* Checked all the 0x addresses with the assembled output, they match perfectly
		..\ExternalTools\dump.exe TestDecompression.prg /noascii /address n /head /lower | ..\ExternalTools\Gnu\bin\sed.exe -n -e "s/^/0x/" -e "s/ /, 0x/g" -e "s/$/,/p" | ..\ExternalTools\Gnu\bin\sed.exe "$ s/.$//"

		C64\Decompression\BuildData.bat
			Mostly works to create the data, the variable names needs to match sC64DecompNoEffect etc




* Implement -c64mrb as -c64mr works



* Test file 5 with -c = 20362
	With RNZip -c = 20529
	RNZip uses only 1 bit escape, no changing escape and simplified escaped length offset encoding in Compression::EncodeMatch
		There may be a case for having an extra option for optimised 6502 decompression code since it would be a lot faster, especially the optimised literal fetch and store
		Potentially a use for the RNCompression code from the library, just make it possible to use a final PackValue(FORCE_UNSIGNED(0x100000)); and skip the BitBufferPutByte(0xff);
	Seems to work with TestDecompressionRNZip.a
	* Done - There seems to be a superfluous lda #0? Check the code output in the visual debugger
	* Need to create TestDecompressionRNZip2.a which is auto extracting
	* Then create tests
	* LZMPi timings for Scroller.bin (54,034 bytes) and TestDecompression2.a:
		3361960		12321343			8959383		480 frames
		Compressed output 18,274 bytes
	* LZMPie (RNZip) timings with TestDecompressionRNZip2.a:
		3053034		8076243				5023209		269 frames
		Compressed output 18,499 bytes
	* So LZMPie decompression a lot faster, and not much difference in size :)
	* Think about the code for TestDecompression2.a and TestDecompressionRNZip2.a
		They are almost identical, it would seem to be easier to keep TestDecompression2.a and assemble time switch it with a predefinition of "Decompress_RNZip = 1" instead




* To aid in debugging, add a test to the: Scenario Outline: Execute LZMPi self extracting compressed output using <option>
	This will compile the various options used in BuildData.bat and test the self extracting code works before using the self extracting tool

	
	
	
* Strange case where with -c64mr when the ending address is not aligned to a page the decompression end check is not triggering correctly.
	* .smRLEByte is correctly encountered, however it looks like the last RLE for the last byte if it's not page aligned is one too many?
	* Maybe a problem in the output data?
	Reproduction: c:\work\C64\bin\LZMPi.exe -c64mrb c:\Temp\BlankProjectOrig.prg c:\Temp\BlankProjectComp.prg $400 && c:\Temp\BlankProjectComp.prg
	Fix: c:\work\C64\bin\LZMPi.exe -c64mrb c:\Temp\BlankProjectOrig2.prg c:\Temp\BlankProjectComp.prg $400 && c:\Temp\BlankProjectComp.prg
	* So, why does adding uncompressed data at the end of the file cure the problem?
		Is it because the end of file output check needs uncompressed data to trigger inside the RLE check properly?
		Decompressed memory is being stored after rthe end address, the final RLE length seems to be bad?
		Use "w store bfff" to trace
		After the store routine (at $d0 currently) the X register contains a non-zero value, but it should be zero?
		The next read, shown by $da, is $ffff
		$fffc shows e3 00 00 *e3*
		The final e3 is the end marker at $ffff
		So when the $e3 is read at $fffc is read is the output counter wrong?
		Is the compression not accounting for the end of the data correctly?
			The decompressed file, when saved at the point of writing to $bfff, is identical
			Which indicates the compression is outputting the wrong ending byte when it's RLE?!
				c:\work\C64\bin\LZMPi.exe -cr c:\Temp\BlankProjectOrig.prg c:\Temp\t.rle
			** Argh!! The debug build outputs the correct RLE ending length, the release build does not!
				* Arghh! x 2 the RLE check was missing the end of file check:  && ((i+j) < inputLength)



* Include an option to set an end of memory for the memory copy end address for the compressed data. This will allow addresses like $ff00-$ffff to be reserved for data transfer between various linekd sections.
	* Include an option to enable or disable interrupts during decompression
		Use LauncherAddress_endOfMemoryMinus256 as it is valid now
		Construct tests to check that the end of memory is not corrupted
	Done: Added -t <address>
