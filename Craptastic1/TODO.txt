Design:

A simple turned based two player gun projectile firing game where the elevation and velocity are chosen by timing a joystick button press.
The guns are located either side of the screen on a randomly generated landscape.
A gun is destroyed by a direct hit or if their supporting landscape characters are destroyed.

Sprite background collision used to detect character hits and dfestroy portions of the landscape.
Sprite to sprite collisions used for the projectile and the guns.

Optional:
Done: Gun aim animation

At the start of the game, each player has the option to place their gun to within a few characters of the screen edge. The ground is flattened under the gun to the highest point. This has a time period of a few seconds.

Each player has a specific amount of time to drop a certain number of landscape pieces at their sides of the screen. This is to allow strategic walls to be built etc.

Random pickups sometimes appear, one at a time, that can be hit for bonuses:
	Volley mode, where a player has the option of sending more than one projectile in their turn.
	Spread shot, more than one projectile...
	Bigger projectile, larger explosion
