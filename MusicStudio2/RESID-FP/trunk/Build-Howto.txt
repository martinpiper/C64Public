Linux build
===========

The directories sidplay-libs-2.1.1 for the libs, and sidplay-2.0.9 for the
client are the important ones. You need to build the libs before the client
program.

Use autoreconf -ivf in both of these directories to generate the autoconfig
files. If making the build files is successful, it will spit out configure
that you can run.

The build-dep command can be used to install the required files to build a
fresh svn checkout.

If you configure and install the libs with a --prefix such as /usr/local,
you will probably need to configure sidplay-2.0.9 with a command like this:

$ ./configure CFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/lib

before it will find the libraries and headers from the right places. (I am
thinking about making sidplay-2.0.9 link the libraries statically to avoid the
need for installing them to system. One of the reasons is that my versions of
these libraries are ABI incompatible with the official ones.)

If you want to build debian packages, the usual way to do this applies once the
autoreconf step has been performed. You would execute "fakeroot debian/rules
binary-arch" in libs, install the debs, and then in the client directory, and
install the sidplay2 program.

Install the ini/sidplay2.ini file to your $HOME/.sidplay directory.

Win32 build
===========

You should install MSVC 2008 Express (it's free). Then open the sln file from
sidplay-2.0.9/win, and compile a Release build. The binaries will be spit out
in bin directory at the trunk level. You must copy the sidplay2.ini file from
ini directory to your $USERPROFILE/Application Data/sidplay2 directory.
(Make it first if it doesn't exist.)
