; Change list
; Original code from http://codebase64.org/doku.php?id=base:flexible_32_sprite_multiplexer
; 25th October 2007 - Martin Piper
; Conversion to ACME plus various tweaks, bug fix (the interrupt was not always saving X for the RTI in all execution paths) and optimisations mostly shown by the "MPi:" comments.
; 26th October 2007 - Martin Piper
; Fixed a slight bug where if one particular sprite was the very last one to be drawn it wouldn't end the IRQ chain correctly.
; Added a test for sprite Y pos = $ff and then it then finishes rendering all further sprites. This is a quick way to disable a sprite from being rendered.
; Added some extra documentation comments.
; 27th October 2007 - Martin Piper
; Tidied this so the multiplexor is in a separate file and made it a bit more modular.
; 28th October 2007 - Martin Piper
; Updated to 48 sprites.
; 3 November 2007 - Martin Piper
; Tidied up some magic numbers to use constants
; 4 November 2007 - Martin Piper
; Added Multiplex_DiscardSpritesYPos
; Added Multiplex_StartTopInterrupt to enable better interrupt flexibility.
; 6 September 2008 - Martin Piper
; Added Multiplex_EnableEarlyOut
; Added Multiplex_OverflowRasterCheck1/Multiplex_OverflowRasterCheck2
; Used macros for the main sprite drawing and sort routines.
; 27 October 2008 - Martin Piper
; Added Multiplex_LeanAndMean to stop the code from allocating memory for the tables.
; 3 May 2009 - Martin Piper
; Added Multiplex_LogCollisions to log VIC collision information.
; 20 June 2009 - Martin Piper
; Added Multiplex_LogCollisionsBackground to include the VIC background sprite collision register.
; 7 June 2014 - Martin Piper
; Added Multiplex_MaintainPriority to enable stricter sprite priority ordering depending on the sprite Y position.
; This is to be compatible with multiplexors found in games like Commando where sprite ordering is important to maintain a sense of perspective.
; Only if the multiplexor detects a horrible sprite formation will ordering be abused and in which case the other tightly packed method will be used.
; 12 June 2014 - Martin Piper
; Added Multiplex_ReverseOrder to reverse the order that sprites are used, 7 to 0 instead of 0 to 7
; 30 May 2016 - Martin Piper
; Added Multiplex_DiscardSpritesYPosUseLocation to allow the discard position to be dynamically updated with Multiplex_SetDiscardPosition


* In Multiplex_intNextSpr0Reset for "lda Multiplex_XPosLo,y" if Multiplex_XPosLo is in ZP then this would benefit from swapping X and Y for the ZP instead of absolute addressing mode



* Added a demo TestMultiplexorOpenBorders define, which enables (currently) 64 sprites with the Y border open and a different tightly packed formation
