; Define "Multiplexor_DebugBorder" to enable border colour debug display.
; The sprite display IRQs will show different colours depending on how many sprites they have updated in the current band.
; This is useful for showing how many sprites are updated on average per band.
; Note: Because the debug border colour change adds code and time patterns of tightly bunched sprites that displayed without a problem may not have enough cycles to display correctly.

; Define the function "MultiplexExt_LastIRQ" before including "SpriteMultiplexor.a" to have this function called from
; within the last IRQ. It is a good time to update sprite position and call Multiplex_Sort
; Multiplex_StartTopInterrupt must be called at some point before the top interrupt is due when defining this function.
; For example if MultiplexExt_LastIRQ doesn't need any further interrupts then use this code:
; jsr Multiplex_Sort
; jsr Multiplex_StartTopInterrupt
; jmp Multiplex_AckExitInterrupt
; If MultiplexExt_LastIRQ triggers other interrupts then call Multiplex_StartTopInterrupt from within one of those.
; Or if the interrupt at the top of the screen is replaced then Multiplex_maininterEx may be called instead.

; Multiplex_BottomTriggered is incremented every time the bottom interrupt is triggered.

; These constants must be defined first otherwise the error "Using oversized addressing mode." occurs.
; Multiplex_VarBase must be defined with a *zero page* base address for the multiplex internal variables.
; For example: Multiplex_VarBase	= $02
; Tell the multiplexor where to store sprite frame definitions. It is also possible to call Multiplex_SetSpritePointer with 'a' containing the hi of the sprite frame address to use. The lo is always set to be f8-ff for the hi address.
; Multiplex_spritepointer	= SPRITEFRAME
; What IRQ vector to use
; Multiplex_IRQServiceRoutineLo = KERNALIRQServiceRoutineLo;
; Multiplex_IRQServiceRoutineHi = KERNALIRQServiceRoutineHi;

; Any sprite Y position >= to this value will stop the multiplexor from generating interrupts to draw any further sprites.
;Multiplex_DiscardSpritesYPos=255
; Define this to make the check use a zero page byte memory location for Multiplex_DiscardSpritesYPosLocation so it can be dynamically updated.
; Multiplex_DiscardSpritesYPosLocation will also be defined as a byte for internal working purposes.
; The function Multiplex_SetDiscardPosition will also be created that sets the discard position from passed in via A.
;Multiplex_DiscardSpritesYPosUseLocation = 1

; Use this statement below to allow the sprite sort to use a bit more time but save using an extra exit interrupt.
; It also helps to save time during the sprite display IRQs which increases the number of sprites that can be displayed.
;Multiplex_EnableEarlyOut = 1

; If using an exit interrupt that occures on or near Multiplex_DiscardSpritesYPos then these two following checks will ensure the multiplexor raster time never steps over this limit.
; Typcially using both checks will give the most robust performance but they are separated here to allow extra tweaking if needed.
; Check during sprite setup
;Multiplex_OverflowRasterCheck1 = 1
; Check before starting a later multiplexor interrupt
;Multiplex_OverflowRasterCheck2 = 1

; Use this statement to enable checks to discard bunches of sprites that violate the maximum of eight sprites on a row.
; This check takes some extra time but results in more sprites being displayed where problem bunches do happen.
; If your sprite patterns are crafted to avoid bunches then this option is best left disabled.
;Multiplex_BunchingCheck = 1

;	Multiplex_YPos
;	Multiplex_XPosLo
;	Multiplex_XPosHi
;	Multiplex_Colour
;	Multiplex_SpriteFrame
;	Multiplex_Sortlo
;	Multiplex_Sorthi
; Each table must be at least Multiplex_items large


; Causes each new IRQ to log VIC2SpriteSpriteCollision along with the raster position and
; what sprites are used in what VIC slots.
; If Multiplex_EnableEarlyOut or MultiplexExt_LastIRQ are defined then "lda VIC2SpriteSpriteCollision;jsr Multiplexor_UpdateCollisionDetails" will have
; to be called after the last sprite is displayed to log the last collision flags.
;Multiplex_LogCollisions = 1
; If Multiplex_LogCollisions is enabled then use the below to also detect sprite background collisions
; Use the following if this is enabled: "lda VIC2SpriteSpriteCollision;ora VIC2SpriteBackgroundCollision;jsr Multiplexor_UpdateCollisionDetails"
;Multiplex_LogCollisionsBackground = 1
; The following memory localtions must be defined for storage:
;	Multiplex_CollisionCounter	- One byte that logs how many entries appear in Multiplex_CollisionRegister
;	Multiplex_CollisionIndexes	- Potentially up to (Multiplex_items-8)*8 items long
;	Multiplex_CollisionHistory - 8 Bytes

;Use this statement to reverse the order that sprites are used, 7 to 0 instead of 0 to 7
;Multiplex_ReverseOrder = 1


; Use this to shift the sprite YPos by 1 or 2 places to the right.
; This can sometimes help to optimise the sort, by reducing the number of buckets, when sprites move around a lot.
