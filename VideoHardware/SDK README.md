Video Hardware
==============

This SDK contains the minimal set of files needed to build, test, and execute emulated video hardware that uses 5V TTL chips. These chips were common in arcade machines before the 1990s and were used to create all manner of customised effects.

Currently this SDK requires Windows and Java 1.8 or better to run. Notably the assembler is C64\acme.exe and this is a Windows specific build.

This SDK contains sources and some built assets from these repositories:
