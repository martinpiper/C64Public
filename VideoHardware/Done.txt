	A thought, why not use the RPG assets? Those demonstrated by TestData2.txt
		The conversion is already setup, they do not use that many palettes
		Could include all the other graphics, especially for the chars and score panel
			Char screen can overlay shops
		The mode7 layer could be used to draw clouds, or other effects like wipe transitions (zooming circle?), over the sprites and tiles

	* Conversion command line for assets
		assets\convert.bat



* Need a good fast way to output stacked sprite sheets for 6502 code
	Optional macro to increment something to count real sprites
		See macros: MEmitSpriteFrame MEmitSpriteFrame_Preserve MEmitSpriteFrame_RestoreExit



* AnimationEngine_Update can be optimised for display/goto/stop/delete by removing the by making MAnimationType* all the same size and removing kAnimationType_size*
	frame routine lo/hi
	stop = hi 0
	delete = hi 1
	otherwise goto = hi/lo address (then no need for any addition code, just store)


* Make SDK bat



* When the screen scrolls the other animations are moved
	Include an off screen check



* Add subtle cloud scaling/sheer/rotate



* When EmitSpriteFrame_count < (24-3) (3 being the most complex stacked sprite in spriteSheet.a)
	Then consider spawning a new sprite on one of the screen edges
	Can use the random number generator in Citadel
		Which would need adding to the SDK build



* Characters move around



* Some clouds horizontally flipped to give more variation



* Added mode7 top down test, yes it looks like Thunder Blade (main.a: Mode7LayersEnable): https://twitter.com/MartinPiper/status/1273987207863267328



* Improved the Mode7LayersEnable documentation. The perpsective effect now has its own scenario.




* When Mode7LayersEnable is enabled, figure out the mathematical relationship with Mode7LayerX/YPos, Mode7Layer0Scale, Mode7Layer1Scale and Mode7Layer2Scale and Mode7Regs0/1/2_x/ypos
	To get the vanishing point in the middle of the screen, the different scales seem to need some extra tweaks?
		e.g. "((Mode7LayerXPos*5)/4) * Mode7Layer2Scale" compared to "(Mode7LayerXPos/2) * Mode7Layer1Scale" compared to "Mode7LayerXPos * Mode7Layer0Scale"
		Trying to simplify, the calculation now uses consistent: Mode7LayerAccuracy = $100
			Far		$200:	(Mode7LayerXPos * Mode7LayerAccuracy * 5)/2				((Mode7LayerXPos*5)/4) * Mode7Layer2Scale
			Middle	$100:	Mode7LayerXPos * Mode7LayerAccuracy						Mode7LayerXPos * Mode7Layer0Scale
			Near	$80:	(Mode7LayerXPos * Mode7LayerAccuracy)/4					(Mode7LayerXPos/2) * Mode7Layer1Scale
		* Now changed to use:
			Mode7Layer1Scale = $80
			Mode7Layer1Multiplier = 1
			Mode7Layer1Divider = 2
			Mode7Layer0Scale = $100
			Mode7Layer0Multiplier = 1
			Mode7Layer0Divider = 1
			Mode7Layer2Scale = $200
			Mode7Layer2Multiplier = 5
			Mode7Layer2Divider = 4
		* After making Mode7Layer*Divider = 256 then the ratios for Mode7Layer*Multiplier become clearer
			Graphing it: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QBX7a31QZNNJsE-wVR33rMleGYEHlFAiU6XOTCAHLBU/edit?usp=sharing
			Obviously some kind of (1+x)/(1/x)
				https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QBX7a31QZNNJsE-wVR33rMleGYEHlFAiU6XOTCAHLBU/edit#gid=0
		* Created: !macro TransformPositionTo24Bit .pos , .scale




* Create a table to allow zoom to be updated in realtime. The 24 bit offset position can be added to this base value for the different scales
	Fire + up/down to zoom in or out ("fly" up and down)




* For @Demo3
	https://www.spriters-resource.com/arcade/arkanoid/



* BatBall
	Done - Add shadows	
	Done - Add simple enemy movement
		Can use 16 bits, then just use the high byte for screen pos
	Done - Add first ball sprites
	Done - Add brick characters
	Done - Add example level bricks
		BlockSet
			BlockScreen will be updated to indcate if it is the left or right hand portion of the block
	Done - Add simple ball movement



* Tidy main3.a



* BatBall : Remove collided blocks
	BlockRemoveChecks removes the blocks with 0 chars
	Done - Need to remove with actual chars from the correct position



* Main3Anim (Arkanoid large ship animation)
	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCfnri9hefQ
	Note the intro sequence shows the ship being damaged, but no green teleport effect
	Also note the game win sequence shows the ship being repaired and the green teleport effect
	These two sequences are not more than 16 frames each, even though there are 20 frames in total
	While converting all of the 20 frames to 8x8 chars gives:
		num tiles=277
		num palettes=9
	The 20 (or even 16) screens are too many, even for the banked char screen (at 2x2 = 4 banks) to display
	However when using the tile layer which has 4x4 = 16 screens:
		java -jar ..\..\..\ImageToBitplane\target\imagetobitplane-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar --rgbshift 4 4 4 --newpalettes --forcergb 255 0 255 --paletteoffset 0 --palettesize 8 --imagequantize 8 --startxy 0 0 --image BatBall\ShipAnim.png --tilewh 16 16 --outputplanes ../tmp/BatBallAnim_plane --outputscrcol ../tmp/BatBallAnim_map.bin --outputpalettes ../tmp/BatBallAnim_palette.bin --numbitplanes 3 --convertwritepass
		num tiles=114
		num palettes=10
	The tile layer can easily store the animations for the intro and outro separately
	* Re-arrange the file so that the frames used in the intro/outro are converted into two "banks" of the large virtual tile screen
		4x4 and another 4x4 map underneath, giving 4x8 in total
		Use the assembler to separate out this data
	* This will output one set of tile planes, but provide two tile maps that can be animated using the scroll registers
		This means, the tile board will need to be constructed
	* Alternative: Since the ships are half screen height:
		Black opaque characters, with some optional stars, can be used to blank out the remaining portion
		Or if black opaque 32x32 sprites are used, it would be possible to use one tile map and blank out the required portion of the screen.
		Some sprites will still be available to use for the explosions, flying ship, lasers, player ship etc
	When using 16x16 tiles, the last few frames, the green beaming effect, does not seem to have quite enough colours for the back portion of the effect
		This could be fixed up with sprites if needed
		The 8x8 chars do not have this issue, due to the palette entries for the smaller area being able to cope
		* Perhaps the grey front part of the ship above the green effect is causing the colour palette to be overloaded?
			Moved the entire ship sheet downwards by 8 pixels, this reduced the used tiles from 114 to 106 !!
			This fixed the green effect, but causes problems with the right top small engine yellow highlight
			* So, for now, don't move the sheet



* 1.0.0.4



* Add char layer to the RPG demo
	Score, inventory, health etc



* Ball collision with bat
	Depending on how far from the middle (or to the edges) the ball return X velocity (hence direction) changes
		Cummulative X velocity change
	For MHandleVelocity, if .SpriteFrameData=SpriteFrameDataY then do the bat test and invert the velocity
	* Logo intro?



* Sprite multiplexing test
	https://twitter.com/MartinPiper/status/1348996589352747010
	MSetSpritesBand is used to quickly update sprites while blanking the sprite output
	* The real hardware shows some flicking left/right pixels during the sprite blanked write period, but where registers are written
		This may indicate even during the blanking, the sprites are picking up a fullscreen height sprite definition due to the floating logic
			Which may be fixed with weak pullups (could test this again)
				*** Weak pullups did not solve the issue, so it's a different problem
		Or it may indicate the sprite blanking logic needs to follow what is seen in the chars/tiles layers instead of using the shifter MR
		** After using logic zero for the sprites, the left/right border issue still happens
			This indicates an issue somewhere outside of the sprites plane
			Bus noise perhaps?
		** It is because I am using the low address for the border blanking signal, and the address bus is active during the sprite writes
			I should really be using a proper logic 0 for the border toggle signals :) Which the tiles board supplies
		** Forcing logic 0 from the power header for the horizontal border fixes the issue



* Add Video_StartRasterTimers
	Start two timers, which should count raster position
	Used by the updated "Multiplexor demo"
	Now using syntax: Given video display add CIA1 timers with raster offset 0 , 0



* It should be possible to have the intro logo in the tiles screen at the top of the screen
	With the animating ship in the bottom half of the screen
	With a screen split somewhere in the middle of the screen
	SetMaskingCharScreen would need to have a hole notched into the top of the masking chars
	Using the background colour register it should also be possible to set the background colour
		Use Video_StartRasterTimers and +MWaitValueToMemoryCC 208 , CIA1TimerBLo


* Ship anim was improved (notable the green teleport effect) by moving the "--imagequantize 8" after the --image load :D




* C64\VideoHardware\asm\main3MultiplexAPU.a
	* "Set address to $9a00" can use EADDR2
	* Setting $9820 can use EADDR and registers 0/1
		* EADDR doesn't need to be refreshed for every sprite, since EADDR2 is used for the enable/disable
			It can just count up instead, making the sprite updates a lot quicker
	* $01 can be in reg2
	* Perhaps add one more data dexmux bit which will select an additional one of the EADDR/EADDR2 register lo/hi values giving 8 "registers" in total?
		Use 74151 instead of 74153?
	* Before optimisation: TotalAPU_Size = $10b2
		With partial optimisation: $bbc
		With enable sprites value removed, and setting two sprites per scanline instead of one: $9cd
			APU sprite register enable timing also improved by using: bdd6502.apu.trace




* C64\VideoHardware\asm\main3MultiplexAPU.a
	Using ADDRB2 it should be possible to have all the "Next RHRV to wait for" and "Disable sprites" values separate from the "Sprite data"
		This would make it easier to write the contiguous block of "Sprite data" from the 6502 and update with an animation




* BuildIt6.bat : main6.a : Shadow of the Beast demo with APU
	https://codetapper.com/amiga/sprite-tricks/shadow-of-the-beast/
	https://www.oldgames.sk/docs/sotb/index.html
	APU copper effects work well
	Validated video simulation with: C64\VideoHardware\target\debugData.txt
	* TODO: Done - Blimps, trees (well?), player?, score display, and Done - moon
		Blimps now move in APU data
		TODO Tree! SetupTree - Will need multiplexing




* SotB demo - Using the map editor, tidy the tiles and chars graphics, especially the clouds and mountains so they wrap better. Can also use flipped tiles/chars.




* SotB game chars layer needs to use map generated asset and include more trees and bushes
	Check the number of characters generated



* SotB demo - Player now stands when not running




* Turrican demo on real hardware
	Note: C64\VideoHardware\asm\Turrican\DisplayData.a
		kDoSprites = 1
		;kDoTiles = 1
		;kDoChars = 1
	This needs RLE compression to decompress, so that the RAM and IO spaces are not overlapping in real C64 memory while sending graphics
		Or instead of RLE, make a CRT file that sends data. However this will need emulation support.
		Simpler to use RLE for now
		* Note comment: Note special write byte goes straight to the video hardware and skips C64 memory entirely
			Graphics data finishes at 70d9 .palette



* Test for and remove Bus24Bit_WriteMakeSafeReset is possible. Should be possible, the memory access logic is completly different.




* Update all examples to use the newer hardware
	RPG demo especially will be able to show more sprites as it won't need to stack so many sprites to get the number of colours it needs
		The 8 colour version used 57 stacked sprites, mostly two and sometimes three sprites were stacked
		The 16 colour version uses 35 stacked sprites. mostly one and two sprties, rarely three are stacked
		Conversion to 16 colours done. Things to note: Using "kAnimationEngine_maxSlots = 12" copySprites on a real C64 takes a few scans too long
			Possible to optimise the sprite data calculation by using a pre-calc buffer
			Done: Use StackedSpriteData
			* RPG demo now uses StackedSpriteData which speeds up the sprite data copy
	* Release updated. Minor screen memory updates needed
	* Release3 updated. The logic to restore the video hardware needed updating to accomodate the new resolution and memory address
	* Release4 works



* RPG Demo and Turrican demo needs to use compressed graphics data for the C64 demo
	** For now MusicPoll and !bin "tmp/target/exportedMusicEvents.cmp" has been disabled
	* Also for now, to match the real hardware, the mode7 layer has been disabled and the background colour set to be the tiles layer



* BuildIt7.bat: Super R-Type
	https://www.spriters-resource.com/fullview/73177/?source=genre
	Need to import some sprites
		Sprites done, also added --loadpaletteraw functionality to the conversion image and fixed a palette selection issue when there are forced colour index values set
	* TODO: Try removing: copy /b /y ..\tmp\Demo7PaletteData1.bin + ..\tmp\Demo7PaletteData2.bin + ..\tmp\Demo7PaletteData3.bin ..\tmp\Demo7PaletteData.bin
		Instead use the normal palette selection code and check it produces an overall palette stack of less than 12
		Didn't work :) Background was using wrong palette values




* APU: Verify increment pulse happens at the start of the instruction
	Verify load pulse happens late, like the write pulse
	* Currently the increment and load edge is at the end of the instruction, due to the hi from the signal being made lo for the instruction period, then rising high again with the next instruction
		To introduce a pulse during the instruction would mean an addition of clock logic, very similar to the external memory write.
		This would effectively remove the need to have two instructions (to create the edge at the end of the instruction) for the increment/load.
	* The emulation, apuHandleInstructionSchedule4, needs to switch the increments after the loads...



* Demo 7 transparent back plane colour
	Then introduce raster bars for the background
	Also fade up the various layers independantly



* Added HardwareTest which adds some standard hardware test routines
	HardwareTest_VideoPattern0 will display a known simple pattern for the chars screen



* main6.a updated to handle slower clocked APU, using JP11 rather than JP10
	Multiplexing tree sprites now use EADDR2 to set kBus24Bit_SpritesControlLo, which saved a lot of cycles

* main9.a
	Even when the movement for the main logo finishes, the scale effect can still rippple along the logo
	The pulse will need to use slightly less scale, since all of the sprites are on the same line.
		Perhaps have a narrower pulse that sometimes ripples across...
		This would happen as the regular sprites are updated for the "2000" part of the logo



* main9.a
	* Done: Add overscan mode, for Sprites2 compatibility
	* Done: Sprite registers at 9800 not 9820
	* Done: Fix main logo right pixel edge issue by bringing in the border like before
	* Done: Add 0x9e09 and 0x9e0a init in code
	* Add wider background?
	* Done: Update logo scroll positions




* main6*.a
	SotB demos need updating to overscan hardware
	APU needs a carry bit output after the add, to allow the tree calculations in the title screen APUTitle.a
	Or this calculation goes into the CPU and it stored to the APU data area off-screen
	* For kAPUData_Tree1Num with MAPUCopySpriteWithAddX and APUMultiplexStrip
		Will need to add X first, to allow the bit to be added to the sprite colour register
		Or the X pos can remain the same going down the screen...
		* Using overscan extent $30 does hide the sprites on the left/right border edges in asm\ShadowBeast\DisplayScreen.a
			But the screen is quite narrow
			The hardware simulation does correctly render with the captured data compared to the emulation, which is good
	* Looking at !macro EmitSprite asm\ShadowBeast\CommonBlimpsMoon.a
		It might be possible to store a sprite MSBX and non-MSBX byte value
		This could be conditionally used by having an optional kAPU_Incr_ADDRB1 based on selecting the high result from the add and using kAPU_SkipIfEQ
		Or there could be a new 16-bit add added to the APU, which adds to a 16 bit value in a register pair...
	* Done: I think, on balance of the complexity, this data should be calculated by the CPU and the data uploaded to the APU for fast copying
		Use MAPU_DataUpdateNumBytes to transfer the calculated data at the right time
		Hardware simulation matches software emulation
	* Done: Tidy "Sprites behind chars" so that it uses MBus24Bit_VideoLayer_EmitPriority_NearToFar_A
	* Done: Game APU code




* Using scaled sprites, some kind of "3D" shooter?
	But the "3D" is just using scaling and some adjusted movement using a perspective table
	No rotation, but can have some translation
	Non-scaled sprites in the background providing background effects?
	The perspective table (like the BDD Sprites2 road demo swing table) can use an appropriate zoom level with some accuracy for fractions of a 32x32 pixel sprite without zoom.
	This means it would be quite easy to transform objects in 3D X&Y screen coordinates
	Added GameSpriteWorldInit, the 3D maths is incomplete
		; Setup X pos
		There needs to be an additional of a perspective correct view X/Y translation as well
		Plus edge of screen checks
		* X coordinates done, need Y
		* Done Y coordinates: https://twitter.com/MartinPiper/status/1526553547315089411
	* Tidy code, use macros
	* Add sprites from suitable game, possibles are:

		https://www.spriters-resource.com/fullview/35153/
		https://www.spriters-resource.com/genesis_32x_scd/superthunderblade/sheet/167431/

		e.g. 
			+MRLEScreenDataToDefaultCharScreen .Chars_map , .Chars_map2
			+MRLEPlanesDataToDefaultCharScreen .Chars_plane0 , .Chars_plane1 , .Chars_plane2 , .Chars_plane3




* Demo9: Could use the use txtVars.a output to produce a table of entities to spawn...
	The player sprites already use "kVarsEmitSpriteFrame_scaled_32_**_0_tileIndex" etc
	Done: Why is kVarsEmitSpriteFrame_scaled_0_64_0_tileIndex undefined?!
		indexPick and tileHasData check is wrong as it's not supporting 32x32 sprites
	Added better sprites for the game section




* Demo9: Add extra chars: kVarsEmitSpriteFrame_scaled_32_128_0_tileIndex=23
	kVarsEmitSpriteFrame_scaled_32_128_0_colour=7
	* Bounce sine scale scroll with names of followers.
